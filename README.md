# Dirty Data: Halloween Candy

## About the Project

A CodeClan project on cleaning, wrangling and combining messy datasets in RStudio.

Survey conducted annually for 3 years asking participants to rate candy and other trick or treating items on 3-point scale (JOY, MEH, DESPAIR), including demographic data. The survey features and formats change every year making the data sets difficult to combine meaningfully without cleaning and wrangling.
